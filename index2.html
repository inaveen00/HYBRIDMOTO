                <h2>The Best Vehicle Brands in Our Rankings</h2>

                <h3>Oftentimes, car shopping starts with choosing a brand. Whether you’re in the market for a car or
                    SUV,
                    there
                    are
                    many great brands with sterling lineups. Our Best Vehicle Brand award aims to identify the top
                    options
                    in
                    the
                    market, giving buyers a leg up on their shopping journey.

                    To break down the diverse offerings you may find on a given brand’s dealership lot, our analysis for
                    this
                    award
                    focuses on four basic categories: cars, SUVs, trucks and luxury vehicles. From each category, we
                    pick a
                    winner
                    based on the brand’s average overall scores. Each winning brand tends to offer options that rank
                    near
                    the
                    top of
                    their respective categories, making them excellent choices for shoppers.</h3>

                <h3>For starters, Honda offers the Civic, which has long been a stalwart of the compact car class and a
                    go-to
                    option for competent and reliable daily transportation. The Civic was fully redesigned for the 2022
                    model
                    year, bringing fresh looks and improved talents. It currently tops our compact car ranking, thanks
                    in
                    part
                    to a contemporary cabin and a healthy roster of standard features. It also offers a flavor of
                    driving
                    excitement as well, with deft handling talents and the option to equip a manual transmission.

                    The Civic also offers a degree of flexibility for different needs, as it’s available in both sedan
                    and
                    hatchback body styles. With the expanded cargo space of a hatch, the Civic is one of the more
                    practical
                    options in the compact class. Its utility is further boosted by great fuel economy ratings<br><br>
                    While the Civic is a leader among compact cars, the larger Honda Accord likewise leads the midsize
                    car
                    class. It has long been one of the most critically acclaimed options in the segment. In fact, the
                    Accord
                    won
                    our own 2021 Best Midsize Car for Families award and was a finalist for our 2021 Best Midsize Car
                    for
                    the
                    Money award. It’s a standout midsize option thanks to a well-rounded set of skills. It handles well
                    and
                    offers strong engine options for driving excitement, while simultaneously offering supportive seats
                    and
                    a
                    spacious interior for daily comfort. The Honda Accord Hybrid is a great alternative among hybrid and
                    electric cars, boasting the same skills as its gasoline counterpart, but with the added bonus of
                    great
                    fuel
                    economy.

                    The Accord Hybrid isn’t the only fuel-efficient option in the Honda lineup, as the brand also offers
                    the
                    conventional hybrid Insight and the plug-in hybrid Clarity. The Honda Insight is an excellent choice
                    if
                    fuel
                    efficiency is a priority, since it’s rated to get up to 55 mpg in city driving and 49 mpg on the
                    highway. It
                    also offers numerous standard driver-assistance features, like lane departure warning and rear cross
                    traffic
                    alert.

                    The Honda Clarity takes hybridized driving to the next level, offering an all-electric range of up
                    to 48
                    miles. It does not sacrifice driving quality though, and, like its stablemates, the Clarity provides
                    balanced ride and handling abilities. Numerous standard features are an additional highlight.</h3>

                <h1>Best SUV Brand: Hyundai</h1>
                <img src="hyundai.png" id="hyundailogo">

                <h3>For the second year running, Hyundai takes the title of our Best SUV Brand. As crossover SUVs grow
                    more
                    and
                    more popular among American shoppers, Hyundai has made strides towards providing a long lineup of
                    options to
                    compete in a variety of classes. If you visit a Hyundai showroom, you’ll find options of all
                    different
                    sizes
                    and prices, including the Venue, Kona, Tucson, Santa Fe and Palisade. There are several alternative
                    fuel
                    variants as well.</h3>

                <div style="width: 100%;">

                <div style="clear:both"></div>

                <h3>Hyundai’s smallest offering, as well as one of it’s newest, is the Venue. Despite its small
                    footprint,
                    this
                    subcompact SUV packs a relatively spacious interior and user-friendly infotainment features. The
                    Venue
                    holds
                    up well against stiff competition, including the top-ranked Hyundai Kona. The Kona leads the class
                    thanks to
                    highlights like an upmarket cabin and comfortable ride quality, in addition to the same
                    accommodation
                    and
                    infotainment perks of the Venue. To top it off, the Kona was named as one of our 2021 Best New Cars
                    for
                    Teens, as well as a finalist for our 2021 Best Subcompact SUV for the Money award.

                    If you need a little bit more space, Hyundai has you covered. Following a complete redesign for the
                    2022
                    model year, the Tucson now ranks at the top of the competitive compact SUV class. Highlights include
                    a
                    robust roster of standard infotainment and active-safety features, as well as a coddling ride. The
                    cabin
                    is
                    also spacious and adorned with premium materials on many interior touch points. Last but not least,
                    the
                    Tucson also earned stellar safety ratings from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS),
                    even
                    earning a 2021 Top Safety Pick+ designation – the organization's top accolade.<br><br>
                    In the midsize SUV segment, the Santa Fe also coddles occupants with comfortable seats and premium
                    materials, but expands on the head- and legroom you’d find in the smaller Tucson. If there’s still
                    not
                    enough space for you and your family, the Palisade comes equipped with three rows of seats. Both of
                    these
                    midsize SUVs offer loads of standard active-safety features, plus numerous optional tech features as
                    well.
                    The Palisade currently holds the top spot in our midsize SUV ranking, and also tops the Hyundai SUV
                    lineup
                    as the largest option.

                    Several of these choices from Hyundai are available with alternative fuel powertrains, and each is
                    competitive among hybrid and electric SUVs on their own merits. The Tucson Hybrid, in addition to
                    much
                    better fuel economy ratings than its purely internal-combustion counterpart, also delivers peppy
                    acceleration that daily drivers will appreciate. It also boasts the top-notch interior quality found
                    in
                    the
                    standard Tucson.

                    The Santa Fe Hybrid is currently among the top-ranked hybrid and electric SUVs. It combines the
                    standard
                    Santa Fe’s strengths like interior quality and passenger space with a powertrain setup that improves
                    fuel
                    economy and delivers smooth acceleration. Drivers that want to part ways with gasoline entirely have
                    the
                    option to choose the Kona EV, which is rated to drive up to 258 miles on a single charge. That
                    figure is
                    very competitive among non-luxury electric vehicles.

                <h3>Ram is our 2022 Best Truck Brand, winning for the third straight year. It’s not only capable of
                    typical
                    truck duties like towing and hauling, but Ram is also recognized as being a class leader in luxury
                    and
                    driving comfort.</h3>

                <h3>
                    Ram prides itself on its player in the competitive full size pickup truck class, the Ram 1500. It is
                    available in multiple different trim levels, ranging from a basic work truck to the high-performance
                    Ram
                    TRX, which comes equipped with a supercharged V8 engine. Upper-level trims are fitted with opulent
                    materials
                    that rival some luxury brands’ offerings. Between its performance and interior quality, the Ram
                    pickup
                    is
                    one of the most versatile vehicles on the market.<br><br>
                    The Ram pickup is available with a wide range of engines to fit a variety of needs, including a
                    diesel
                    and a
                    V8 with a mild-hybrid system. When equipped with the right engine and trim level, the Ram 1500 is
                    able
                    to
                    tow up to 12,750 pounds and haul as much as 2,300 pounds. While those figures may not best the Chevy
                    Silverado or Ford F-150, they are still better than all other full-size trucks.

                    What sets the Ram 1500 apart from all of its competitors is how luxurious it is – both in terms of
                    performance on the road and its interior quality. It provides a smooth ride, and even a relatively
                    agile
                    experience that can (almost) let people forget they’re driving a full-size truck. Inside, the Ram is
                    far
                    above its competition. There are premium materials throughout the cabin and there is plenty of
                    space.
                    Seats
                    are both roomy and comfortable, and it’s easy to get in and out.

                    Additionally, Ram’s infotainment system deserves praise. It’s one of the best in the class and is
                    very
                    easy
                    to use. It’s also available with one of the largest touch screens in the segment, with customizable
                    menu
                    shortcuts.

                    When it comes down to it, Ram’s quality both on the road and inside the cab help it win the title of
                    the
                    Best Truck Brand for 2022.

                    Porsche is best known for its sports cars, including the Boxster and Cayman, as well as the iconic
                    911.
                    All
                    three cars place in the top five in the luxury sports car class, mainly because of their
                    segment-leading
                    performance and handling.

                    Whether you choose a hardtop or convertible, these Porsches feature mid- or rear-mounted engines.
                    This
                    placement creates dynamic handling ability, whether you’re driving on a winding road or on a track.
                    Additionally, there are plenty of powertrain configurations to choose from. You can opt for
                    four-cylinder
                    and six-cylinder engines, rear-wheel or all-wheel drive, and an automatic or manual transmission.

                    If you’re looking for something sporty but with more space, the Panamera adds a second row of seats
                    without
                    sacrificing much in the way of performance. It also has plenty of available engine options,
                    including
                    everything from a V6 to a twin-turbocharged V8 plug-in hybrid. The Panamera ranks among the best
                    super
                    luxury cars.<br><br>
                    If you need even more space than the low-slung Panamera, Porsche also offers three SUVs. The
                    refreshed
                    Macan
                    is a luxury compact SUV with three turbocharged engine options and an opulent interior. Its
                    infotainment
                    system is easy to use, and the front seats are comfortable with plenty of head- and legroom.

                    Another option is the larger Cayenne. It offers many of the same features as the Macan, but includes
                    more
                    space in the cabin and cargo hold, as is expected with the step up to the luxury midsize SUV class.
                    The
                    Cayenne also has a hybrid counterpart, if you’re looking for better fuel efficiency.

                    Speaking of fuel-efficient vehicles, Porsche also recently jumped into the electric car market with
                    the
                    Taycan, the brand’s first battery-electric vehicle. The Taycan stays true to Porsche’s excellent
                    driving
                    experience with blistering acceleration and sporty handling. The standard Taycan gets an
                    EPA-estimated
                    range
                    of 199 miles, but with a battery upgrade, can reach up to 227 miles.

                    If you’re able to pay the high price tag for a Porsche, you’ll find that various powerful engine
                    options,
                    athletic driving capabilities and premium materials are commonplace throughout the lineup. Whichever
                    model
                    you choose – be it a sports car, SUV or the electric Taycan – you’ll come away with one of the most
                    opulent
                    and best-driving choices in their respective class
