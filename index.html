            <h1>What is a Hybrid Car and How Do They Work?</h1>

            <h3>Quite simply, a hybrid combines at least one electric motor with a gasoline engine to move the car, and
                its
                system recaptures energy via regenerative braking. Sometimes the electric motor does all the work,
                sometimes
                it's the gas engine, and sometimes they work together. The result is less gasoline burned and,
                therefore,
                better fuel economy. Adding electric power can even boost performance in certain instances.<br>

                With all of them, electricity comes from a high-voltage battery pack (separate from the car's
                conventional
                12-volt battery) that's replenished by capturing energy from deceleration that's typically lost to heat
                generated by the brakes in conventional cars. (This happens through the regenerative braking system.)
                Hybrids also use the gas engine to charge and maintain the battery. Car companies use different hybrid
                designs to accomplish different missions, ranging from maximum fuel savings to keeping the vehicle's
                cost as
                low as possible.</h3>

                    <h3>These blue emblem became so symbolic of the green movement that a bit of hybrid car backlash had
                        started. Blue is associated with environmentally consciousness. Perhaps you may wonder or have
                        been
                        hearing about the term Green for environment for a very long timeAnd before you could say, “It's
                        gettin' real in the Whole Foods parking lot”, the Prius
                        became the symbol of all that was West Coast, green, LA, hipster, and all that.From Mercedes'
                        BlueTec technology to Hyundai's Blue Drive, blue is the hue used to convey Earth-friendly
                        mobility.
                        Toyota uses blue to brand the Prius and other hybrid cars, Volkswagen touts its BlueMotion
                        badge,
                        and Mazda wraps its zero-emission fuel cell cars in bright blue trim.</h3>

                    <h30>Parallel Hybrid</h30>
                    <h4>In this most common design, the electric motor(s) and gasoline engine are connected in a common
                        transmission that blends the two power sources. That transmission can be an automatic, a manual,
                        or
                        a continuously variable transmission (CVT). One very popular hybrid transmission is a
                        power-split
                        CVT, which is used by the Toyota Prius and Chevrolet Volt. Transmission type and the size of the
                        gasoline engine are the main factors that determine how a parallel hybrid will accelerate,
                        sound,
                        and feel. This is the most common hybrid system as of 2016. Brands that use the parallel design
                        include Toyota, Lexus, Hyundai, Kia, Ford, Honda,
                        Lincoln, Nissan, Infiniti, Peugeot 3008, Peugeot 508, 508 RXH.

            <div class="float-child">
                <div class="blue">
                    <h30>Series Hybrid</h30>
                    <h4>
                        In this design, the electric motor(s) provides all the thrust, and there is never a physical
                        mechanical connection between the engine and the wheels. The gasoline engine is just there to
                        recharge the battery. This results in a driving experience that's more indicative of an electric
                        car, with smoother, powerful acceleration. There's typically less vibration when the gasoline
                        engine
                        engages. However, that engagement doesn't always happen in concert with what your right foot is
                        doing (remember, the battery is making the demands), so the engine might be revving up while the
                        car
                        is cruising at a steady speed. Some find this behavior disconcerting. The BMW i3 with the range
                        extender is an example of a series hybrid.
                    </h4>

                <div class="yellow">
                    <h30>Plug-In Hybrid</h30>
                    <h4>
                        A plug-in hybrid enhances the conventional hybrid concept with a much larger battery pack that,
                        like
                        an electric car's, must be fully recharged using an external electricity source—from your home,
                        office, or public charging station. This greater amount of energy storage is like a larger gas
                        tank:
                        It allows for extended all-electric driving (between 15 and 55 miles depending on the model) and
                        can
                        significantly reduce fuel consumption. In fact, if you have a short commute and recharge
                        nightly,
                        you'll be running on electricity most of the time. Should you deplete the all-electric range,
                        the
                        car basically reverts to being a conventional parallel hybrid. The Chrysler Pacifica plug-in
                        hybrid
                        is an example of the plug-in breed.

                                <h6>Hybrid vehicles can be driven entirely with electricity. This usually happens while
                                    moving at low speeds, when the engine is idling at a stoplight or when the engine
                                    starts
                                    up. Normally, the internal combustion engine starts operating only at higher speeds,
                                    where it has more efficiency. This helps increase the overall fuel efficiency of the

                                <h6>With a continuous increase in the price of gasoline, more and more people are
                                    turning
                                    towards hybrid cars. The result is that these green vehicles have started commanding
                                    higher than average resale values. So, in case you are not satisfied with your
                                    vehicle,
                                    you can always sell it at a premium price to buyers looking for it.

                                    There are many advantages to owning a hybrid car. The one you will like the best is

                                    benefit that is not seen directly is how owning and driving a hybrid car impacts the
                                    environment. It reduces the dependence on fossil fuels and lowers your carbon

                                    power, is much smaller as compared to what you get in single-engine powered cars

                                    $10000 more than a standard version. However, that extra amount can be offset with

                                    resulted in motor and battery downsizing and less support in the suspension and

                                    issue with recycling lies in the collection rate of vehicle batteries.

                                    The same problem lies in recycling lithium batteries in mobile electronics. Although
                                    lithium is 100% recyclable, extracting it costs too much to make it of high economic
                                    value. It is only done because of federal mandates and/or ecological purposes.</h6>

                friendly. You have to look at the resources in your area that can help you maintain and sustain the car.

                Depending on the type of car you purchase, you may need mechanics that are familiar with it or an
                alternate
                fuel source. You should also look into any credits or discounts that may be available to help you lower

                One
                of the most important considerations is how you drive. You can replace many of your car trips by using
                public transportation, carpooling or even riding a bicycle.

                Also, planning to use the car more effectively can reduce the overall number of trips you are making
                each
                week. Hybrid or not, the less you drive, the better it is for the environment. You should also consider
                offering to be the carpool driver more if you are the one with the hybrid, this can also help to
                conserve
                energy and lessen pollution.</h4>
